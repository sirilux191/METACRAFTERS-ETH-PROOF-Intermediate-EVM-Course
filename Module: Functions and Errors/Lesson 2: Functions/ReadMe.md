# MiniCalculator

A simple smart contract implemented in Solidity for a mini calculator. This contract provides basic mathematical operations such as addition and generates random numbers.

## Usage

### Donate

Users can donate funds to the contract by calling the Donate() function and providing the desired amount of funds to donate. The donated funds will be added to the contract's balance.

### Withdraw

Only the owner of the contract can withdraw donations from the contract. To withdraw funds, the owner needs to call the Withdraw() function and specify the amount of funds to withdraw and the recipient address. The contract will check if the owner has sufficient balance and transfer the specified amount to the recipient address. It's important to note that the contract must have enough balance to cover the withdrawal amount.

### Generate Random Number

The contract has a GenerateRandomNumber() function that accepts an input parameter x and returns a random number. The random number is generated by multiplying x with a pseudo-random number generated using the current block's timestamp. This can be useful for generating unpredictable random numbers within a specific range.

### Addition

The Add() function performs the addition of two numbers. Users can call this function and provide two numbers a and b. The function will return the sum of the two numbers.

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MiniCalculator.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract MiniCalculator {
    uint16 private n = 786;          //Fixed input to generate random number
    address public immutable owner;  //Public varible to check owner of contract
    uint256 public balance;          //Public varible to check balance of contract

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;          //Initiliazes creater as owner of contract
    }

    modifier onlyOwner {              //Modifier for withdraw function
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only Owner can withdraw donations");
        _;
    }

    function Donate() public payable {     //Function to accept Donations
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    function Withdraw(uint256 amount, address payable recipient) public onlyOwner{
        require(balance >= amount, "You don't have enough balance");                      //Checks if balance is available
        require(recipient != address(0), "You are transferring amount to zero address");  //Prevents from sending ether to zero address
        balance -= amount;                                                                //Updating value of balance
        payable(recipient).transfer(amount);                                              //Transferring amount to recipient address
    }

    function GenerateRandomNumber(uint256 x) external view returns (uint256){             //Function to generate random number
        return( x * random());
    }

    function random() internal view returns(uint256){     //Function to generate pseudo random number using timestamp of block
        return (n * block.timestamp);
    }

    function Add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256){  //Function for addition of two input positive numbers
        return (a+b);
    }

}
```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MiniCalculator.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MiniCalculator" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the Donate, GenerateRandomNumber or Add function.
